# Privacy Policy for PopcornLens

**Last updated:** February 9, 2026

## 1. Overview
PopcornLens ("we", "our", or "the extension") is a browser extension dedicated to enhancing movie websites by displaying ratings and metadata. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

## 2. Data Collection
We **do not** collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data, browsing history, or usage analytics to our own servers. The extension runs entirely locally on your device.

## 3. Data Storage
PopcornLens stores the following information locally on your device using the Chrome Storage API:
*   **API Key:** Your The Movie Database (TMDB) API Key.
*   **Preferences:** Settings such as preferred language and font size.
*   **Cache:** Temporary movie data (ratings, titles) to improve performance and reduce network requests.

This data is synced with your Google account (if you use Chrome Sync) or stored locally on your machine. It is never shared with the developer.

## 4. Third-Party Services
PopcornLens interacts with the following third-party service:

*   **The Movie Database (TMDB):** The extension sends search queries (containing movie titles) to the TMDB API to retrieve ratings.
    *   Please review [TMDB's Privacy Policy](https://www.themoviedb.org/privacy-policy) for details on how they handle API requests.

The extension also modifies checking content on specific websites (e.g., IMDb, Cinecalidad) but does not transmit data about your visits to those sites to anyone.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions about this policy, please contact us via the support section on the Chrome Web Store.
